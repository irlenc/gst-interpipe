/*
 * Producer latency propagation.
 *
 * A clock-synced interpipesink (sync=true) hands each buffer over only at
 * running time + latency + ts-offset - render-delay, so under passthrough-ts
 * and compensate-ts every buffer reaches the consumer that much behind its
 * running time. The consumer must learn about that delay through its own
 * LATENCY query, or every clock-synced element downstream treats the buffers
 * as late.
 *
 * The producer pipeline's latency is pinned with GstPipeline:latency so the
 * value is deterministic rather than whatever audiotestsrc reports. Every
 * consumer sink runs sync=true: GstBaseSink only answers "live" (and GstBin
 * only configures latency) when the sink syncs to the clock.
 *
 * The consumer's sink is configured with the upstream latency plus its own
 * processing deadline. interpipesrc answers an unbounded maximum, so the
 * deadline always fits; a bounded maximum equal to the minimum would make the
 * sink drop it.
